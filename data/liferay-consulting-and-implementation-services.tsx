    Over the past decade, my journey with Liferay has been a fascinating one. I’ve been there from its version
    6.0 and have watched it take significant steps in OSGI frameworks. I’ve followed its progress in OSGI
    frameworks and witnessed its evolution from a basic Enterprise Content Management System (CMS) into a
    comprehensive and highly Advanced Digital Experience Platform (DXP). Along the way, I’ve seen the
    introduction of groundbreaking solutions like Liferay Commerce, the establishment of Liferay Analytics
    Cloud, and the enhancement of its headless architecture capabilities. Liferay stands as a genuine digital
    experience platform, consistently leading the way in the domain of digital transformation. It empowers
    businesses to craft immersive and personalized experiences for both customers and employees. What truly
    sets Liferay apart is its exceptional ability to tailor solutions to meet the unique needs of various
    industries. Working with Liferay has been both enlightening and fulfilling, and I’m excited to continue
    this journey.
